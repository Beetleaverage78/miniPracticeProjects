============================
CompanyName: ChainFresh
============================'

Notes:
	Its Not Very Responsive - it will look worse on smaller screens lol.
	
	When loading Product & Services Page wait for a bit. because..

	Product Page items are actually generated on the go through a google sheets database.
	Which you can find here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18O3iVwk2ttJe7ALAZe4PpUwJ7ulWytMKUdP8IdNdkRE/edit?usp=sharing
	(Feel free to add your own products, it should automatically update)

	There is a lot of bugs in terms of displaying the website, and could have probably added more functionality i.e. the
	slider in the sort by for product page, but had no time.

	Overall, it could be better? :(

	Also do not take the prices seriously, I also did not have time to search up market price and weights for stuff.
